Exercises: Introduction to Entity Framework
This document defines the exercise assignments for the "Databases Advanced – EF Core" course @ Software University.
1.	Import the SoftUni Database
Import the SoftUni database into SQL Management Studio by executing the provided .sql script.
 
2.	Database First
Model the existing database by using Database First.
First create a new empty .Net Core ConsoleApplication and after it is created open the Package Manager Console:
 
It will look something like this:
 
Use it to run the following commands one by one:
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools –v 3.1.3
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer –v 3.1.3
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer.Design
These are the packages you will need, in order to scaffold our SoftUniContext from the SoftUni database.
Next, we must execute the command to scaffold our context class. It will consist of 4 things:
•	First, the name of the command:
Scaffold-DbContext
•	Second, the connection we will be using (our connection string):
-Connection "Server=<ServerName>;Database=<DatabaseName>;Integrated Security=True;"
For ServerName, use the name of your local MS SQL Server instance or ".".
For DatabaseName, use the name of the database you want to use, in this case – SoftUni.
•	Third, we need to declare our service provider, we’ll be using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer:
-Provider Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
•	And the fourth thing we’ll do, is to give it a directory where all of our models will go (e.g. Models):
-OutputDir Data/Models
Our final command will look like this:
Scaffold-DbContext -Connection "Server=.;Database=SoftUni;Integrated Security=True;" -Provider Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir Data/Models
Execute the whole command on a single line
Entity Framework Core has successfully mapped the database schema to C# classes. However, it isn't good enough with names – all classes have been pluralized. Use the Solution Explorer in Visual Studio to move the SoftUniContext class out of Models into the Data folder and rename all of our classes properly. Use right click → Rename or the F2 shortcut and press OK on this pop up window after each class:
 
This way Visual Studio will also rename the classes everywhere they’re used.
The final result should look like this:
 
Don’t forget to fix the SoftUniContext’s namespace after moving it and add a reference to the Models namespace:
Make sure that your namespaces are exactly the same as these:
SoftUni
SoftUni.Data
SoftUni.Models
Finally, we want to clean up the packages we won’t be using anymore from the package manager GUI or by running these commands:
Uninstall-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools -r
Uninstall-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer.Design -RemoveDependencies
3.	Employees Full Information
NOTE: You will need method public static string GetEmployeesFullInformation(SoftUniContext context) and public StartUp class. 
Now we can use the SoftUniContext to extract data from our database. Your first task is to extract all employees and return their first, last and middle name, their job title and salary, rounded to 2 symbols after the decimal separator, all of those separated with a space. Order them by employee id.
Example
Output
Guy Gilbert R Production Technician 12500.00
Kevin Brown F Marketing Assistant 13500.00
…
4.	Employees with Salary Over 50 000
NOTE: You will need method public static string GetEmployeesWithSalaryOver50000(SoftUniContext context) and public StartUp class. 
Your task is to extract all employees with salary over 50000. Return their first names and salaries in format “{firstName} - {salary}”.Salary must be rounded to 2 symbols, after the decimal separator. Sort them alphabetically by first name.
Example
Output
Brian - 72100.00
Dylan - 50500.00
…
Use Express Profiler and check if the query Entity Framework Core sent is correct (there is only one query, but there may be more that are performed by EF for checks).
 
5.	Employees from Research and Development
NOTE: You will need method public static string GetEmployeesFromResearchAndDevelopment(SoftUniContext context) and public StartUp class. 
Extract all employees from the Research and Development department. Order them by salary (in ascending order), then by first name (in descending order). Return only their first name, last name, department name and salary rounded to 2 symbols, after the decimal separator in the format shown below:

Example
Output
Gigi Matthew from Research and Development - $40900.00
Diane Margheim from Research and Development - $40900.00
…

Use Express Profiler and check if the made query by Entity Framework is correct (there is only one query).
 
6.	Adding a New Address and Updating Employee
NOTE: You will need method public static string AddNewAddressToEmployee(SoftUniContext context) and public StartUp class. 
Create a new address with text "Vitoshka 15" and TownId 4. Set that address to the employee with last name "Nakov".
Then order by descending all the employees by their Address’ Id, take 10 rows and from them, take the AddressText. Return the results each on a new line:
Example
Output
Vitoshka 15
163 Nishava Str, ent A, apt. 1
…
After this restore your database for the tasks ahead!
Hints
Create the address and find the employee with last name equal to "Nakov" in order to assign the address to him.
7.	Employees and Projects
NOTE: You will need method public static string GetEmployeesInPeriod(SoftUniContext context) and public StartUp class. 
Find the first 10 employees who have projects started in the period 2001 - 2003 (inclusive). Print each employee's first name, last name, manager’s first name and last name.

14.	Delete Project by Id
NOTE: You will need method public static string DeleteProjectById(SoftUniContext context) and public StartUp class. 
Let's delete the project with id 2. Then, take 10 projects and return their names, each on a new line. Remember to restore your database after this task.
Example
Output
Classic Vest
Full-Finger Gloves
…
Hints
If we try to delete the project directly:
 
This happens:
 
The project is referenced by the junction (many-to-many) table EmployeesProjects. Therefore we cannot safely delete it. First, we need to remove any references to that row in the Projects table. 
This is done by removing the project from all employees who reference it.
 
15.	Remove Town
NOTE: You will need method public static string RemoveTown(SoftUniContext context) and public StartUp class. 
Write a program that deletes a town with name „Seattle”. Also, delete all addresses that are in those towns. Return the number of addresses that were deleted in format “{count} addresses in Seattle were deleted”. There will be employees living at those addresses, which will be a problem when trying to delete the addresses. So, start by setting the AddressId of each employee for the given address to null. After all of them are set to null, you may safely remove all the addresses from the context.Addresses and finally remove the given town.
Example
Output
44 addresses in Seattle were deleted
